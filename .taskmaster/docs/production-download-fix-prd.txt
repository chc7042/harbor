# Production Download Fix - PRD

## Critical Issue

**Current Problem**: On production website `http://harbor.roboetech.com`, when clicking the main version download button for 3.0.0, the download does NOT start immediately. Users experience 2-3 seconds delay before download begins.

**Expected Behavior**: Download should start immediately upon button click (within 1 second).

## Root Cause Analysis

The local development environment has been updated with instant download functionality (using hidden `<a>` tag click instead of `window.location.href`), but **production environment is still running the old code**.

## Critical Actions Required

### 1. Production Code Version Check
- Verify what version of frontend code is currently running on harbor.roboetech.com
- Check if the instant download fix (downloadViaRedirect with hidden link) is deployed
- Confirm production environment configuration

### 2. Emergency Production Deployment
- Build updated frontend code with instant download fix
- Deploy to production server immediately
- Ensure zero-downtime deployment

### 3. Production Environment Verification
- Test actual 3.0.0 main file download on harbor.roboetech.com
- Verify download starts within 1 second of button click
- Confirm no browser compatibility issues

## Technical Solution Summary

**Fixed Code (Local)**: 
- Changed `window.location.href = downloadUrl` to hidden `<a>` tag click
- Added fallback with `window.open` method
- Maintains backend streaming functionality

**Production Deployment**:
- Update frontend container with latest code
- Clear browser cache if needed
- Test with actual large files

## Success Criteria

1. **Immediate Start**: 3.0.0 main file download starts within 1 second on harbor.roboetech.com
2. **Production Stable**: No regressions in other download functionality
3. **User Experience**: Seamless download experience for all file sizes

## Priority: CRITICAL
This is affecting real users on the production website right now.
